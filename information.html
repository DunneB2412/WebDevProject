            <h2>Why my website is like this</h2>
            Unfortunatly I am not the most immaginative type to i desided to create a template which if i found a subject i could apply it to
            regretably i have not found a subject but i wantes to compensate with putting effort into the visual layout of the page. basiclly
            finalising a template with examples of use like this(finished with a beautifull logo and picture, also i made them, don't let bob decieve you).
            <hr>
            <h2>Designs</h2>
            <h4>Nav bar (side and top)</h4>
            This wasa supprisingly difficult to make work as the items seemed to like to wander and the <i>sticky</i> funstion didn't want to
            co-opperate. But ultimatly the whole top nav bar to get to your main pages and a side bar to get to all the other nooks and
            crannies of the websight all following you as you go felt like a rely nice feature and it is something i see in so many.
            professionally built websites <br>
            <h4>Header with logo and page name</h4>
            Personally i just like the whole idea of there being a fabulous header always letting you know who's website you are in.
            I don't know how to justify having it, but I just like it so much i feel it is needed.
            <h4>Support for pictures at the side of the pages</h4>
            "A picture is worth a thousand words" as the saying gows, giving the option to add a picture or two isquite nice.
            In regards to it being at te side I think it frees up space for all that jucy text and information that would be
            on a website.
            <h4>sub page not having side nav</h4>
            pesonally i believe that the leaves of a websight shouldnt be able to jump from one to another, they must
            go back to a major page(branch) or home(the trunk) to get to other leaves. this I feel gives the page
            a tree like feel, sortive like i described it. i am open to feed back on this design aspect.
